# mycode
This is the first repository created during a structured python course.  Contents may be unstable and constantly shifting.

## Overview

This repository contains all scripts created in class.  As of 23 May 2018 there is no strict or coherent organizational structure to how these scripts are arrayed in this repo.  As the scripts multiply and flourish I may come back and implement a more orderly file structure.
